This is a paragraph! And *this text is italic* and **this text is bold**. And now for some inline `code`.

Code block starts after this:
```typescript
export default async function handler(req, res) {
    res.status = 200;
    res.body = JSON.stringify({ data: "Hello world!" });
    return res;
}
```
